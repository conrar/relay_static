Some instructions:

Please try and touch the html as little as possible, however you can add
all the classes and ids you feel are necessary.

Right now each of the three sections is wrapped inside a <section> tag.
Inside that there is div.mainbar and aside.sidebar. Those are the main layout elements.

.current_user class is meant to be used to style the progress_bar that belongs to
the current user or his team.

.current_page class is meant to be used to style the link in the nav bar that points
to the current page.

Length of a progress bars is determined in its data-progress attribute, which is dynamically
created in the back-end. You can play around with these values to see how
progress bars of different lengths would look.

As you can see, I used a table for the "Rivals" sections and plain floated elements for the "Team"
section. This was probably a bad idea. Feel free to change it, but if you can live with it, even better.
